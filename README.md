This project utilizes data Analysis for the performance of Pharmaceutical over the course of 45 days and observed the development of tumors and their measurements in mice.

In this Project which is a data set of 249 Mice here were studied for Tumor volume after being given a drug regimen.

* Sanitized data of any duplicate time point associated with mouse ID![Screen Shot 2022-01-20 at 10 32 23 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33403205/150373089-30e5f0a1-28f9-4d92-95d4-f71dbf83fa55.png)

* Made a summary of statistics table consisting of Mean,Median, variance, standard deviation and SEM of tumor volume of Drug manufactor in regimen.
* Created bar![Screen Shot 2022-01-20 at 10 32 30 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33403205/150373112-fdcccfc7-979f-49a4-9f02-71a12d503215.png)
 plots in Panda's .plot![Screen Shot 2022-01-20 at 10 32 43 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33403205/150373140-dedebdef-32dc-49c3-8527-b4b2004b5798.png)
 and Matplot's .pyplot to disply the number of measurements for treatments of Drugs.

* Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.


* Calculated the tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.![Screen Shot 2022-01-20 at 10 32 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33403205/150373160-e3508016-0ce5-41a1-a494-a21ccfa7795c.png)

* Used Matplotlib to generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.

 
* Selected  a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.

* Generated a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

* Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.

* Perused across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.
